Tool description
========================================================

The Death Year Prediction is a rather simple tool, really.
It needs a user input of:

- Birth Year
- Gender

Then the tool presents the user with an estimate of a death year for the input.

Tool description (cont.)
========================================================

The Death Year calculation is based on the average world life expectancy for 2010-2013.
In that time period the average life expectancy for men has been 69 years, while the women around the globe had average life expectancy of 74 years (rounded up).
